This project is the hardware and software design for sensorless BLDC driver.

Hardware design files are in sch_pcb folder, 12V power source is used for example. 
Soucre code files for motor control are in 'code' folders. The source code can be changed to adapt different motors or input voltage.

These source code can be compiled by MPLAB IDE v8.x with xc16-v1.2x Compiler.
